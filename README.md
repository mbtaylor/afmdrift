AFMDRIFT
========

Some experiments trying to characterise drift errors
from Atomic Force Microscopy data.

This package contains a framework for testing,
tools for generating synthetic data,
and a makefile to generate some output files and visualisation
(in conjunction with STILTS).

Not currently really intended for public consumption.
